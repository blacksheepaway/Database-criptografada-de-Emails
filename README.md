# Email Database

Welcome to the Email Database project! This application allows users to securely store and manage their email information locally, demonstrating your ability to work with encryption, file handling, and GUI development in Python.

## How it Works

The Email Database application stores user email information, such as name, email, and password, in an encrypted format using the `cryptography` library. The information is saved in a local text file and can be easily added or removed through the user-friendly interface created with `tkinter` and `ttkthemes`.

## Technologies and Techniques

- Python
- `tkinter` and `ttkthemes` for creating the dark-themed GUI
- `cryptography` library for encrypting and decrypting email data
- File handling for managing the email database
- List manipulation and enumeration

## Example

Using the Email Database application is straightforward. Users can add email information by entering the name, email, and password in the respective fields and clicking the "Add Email" button. The saved emails will be displayed below, with an "Erase" button to remove individual entries.

## Modification for Other Applications

The Email Database application can be easily modified for various purposes. For example, you could:
- Develop a password manager by adjusting the data storage structure and GUI
- Add functionality to edit existing entries
- Implement additional encryption methods or user authentication
- Integrate with a web service or API to fetch and store data remotely
